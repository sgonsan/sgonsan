# Hello World! I'm Sergio Gonz√°lez S√°nchezüëã

I'm a software developer from Spain. I'm currently studying a degree in Computer Engineering at the University of La Laguna. I'm passionate about technology and programming, and I love learning new things. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow my skills

## Skills

- **Languages**: I'm proficient in C++ and Python, and I have experience with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- **Tools**: I have experience with Git, Docker, and Linux, and I'm familiar with the use of IDEs like Visual Studio Code.
- **Networking**: I have knowledge of networking concepts and subnetting, and I'm familiar with the use of tools like Tailscale.
- **Virtualization**: I have experience with virtualization software like Proxmox, managing virtual machines and containers.

## Projects

- **[Wake](https://github.com/sgonsan/Wake-On-Lan_Manager)**: A simple C++ tool to manage and send Wake-on-LAN (WOL) packets to devices on your network. It allows you to register MAC addresses of your devices, save them in a local database, and wake them up when you need to, using the `wake` command-line tool. This project uses the `wakeonlan` utility to send WOL packets on Linux systems and the `nlohmann/json` library for JSON handling in C++.
- **[Random Access Machine](https://github.com/sgonsan/RAM)**: An implementation of a Random Access Machine (RAM) in C++. The RAM is a theoretical computer that can be used to model the execution of algorithms. The RAM has a set of registers, a memory, a program counter, and an instruction set. The RAM is capable of executing instructions in a sequential order and can perform basic arithmetic operations.
